# vday-2k23-pydungeon
Simple python-based dungeon game built for the PyGamer board but written with CircuitPython libraries that can be run on any capable device with a few adjustments.

Should be able to run on any board that is a valid target for CircuitPython. See https://circuitpython.org/downloads for a full list of boards that can run. Not every board will have Stage and uGame available by default!

Adafruit_display_text, adafruit_imageload, and neopixel modules should be added to /lib if not already available on the target board.
